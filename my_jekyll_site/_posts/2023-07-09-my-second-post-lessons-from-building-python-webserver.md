# TL;DR
This post is a reflection on the inspirations I recieved upon completing a proof-of-concept website, built with flask, while following the module content from Andrei Neagoie's Zero To Mastery course 'Complete Python Developer in 2023'.  It also covers helpful external materials referenced in the course and tees up the next step on my portfolio-building website adventure

## TL;DR - hot take edition
In this post you will learn what lessons I learned while completing Andrei's Zero To Mastery (ZTM) Python course- 
*No you won't be getting a freebie about what he taught, he taught how to build a webserver with flask and you're better off following the course or reading the docs yourself ;)*
You WILL learn what services you could use to host your webserver and helpful materials publicly available from the ZTM community and elsewhere (such as from the GitHub student developer pack for you budding academics out there).
I will also provide some comments on why I chose not to go down the Flask route, tl;dr i was poor at the time and didn't fancy paying for hosting, however smol (small). Wrapping up with a pointer to a less-known and nearly as powerful web serving platform - GitHub Pages!!
