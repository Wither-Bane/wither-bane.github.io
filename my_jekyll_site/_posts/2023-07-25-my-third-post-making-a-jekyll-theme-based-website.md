# TL;DR
This post is the next step on my portfolio-building website adventure. It follows my choices in trying to adapt my heart-chosen website template to working on GitHub pages with ~~maximum~~ **minimum** effort ( [sorry deadpool](https://media.tenor.com/Y-7gVwgzqbYAAAAC/maximum-effort-deadpool.gif) ), learning about the brilliant Jekyll static site builder that is built into GitHub Pages web server technology, its answer to Flask website templating in the form of Liquid (not too much on Liquid though), and the roundabout journey for me trying out different themes only to find out I could just turn my heart-chosen website template from HTML5up into a *** *click* VeRy NiCe*** Jekyll template and the journey so far in completing it (another journey through git logs, lets gooooo)
