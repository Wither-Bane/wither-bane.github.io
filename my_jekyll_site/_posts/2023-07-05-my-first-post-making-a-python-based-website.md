# TL;DR
This post tracks my decision to make my own website "for fun and profit" and the progress I made producing said website with the Flask framework while following the module content from Andrei Neagoie's Zero To Mastery course 'Complete Python Developer in 2023'. 

# TL;DR - hot take edition
In this post you will learn the various motivations for me finally wanting to make my own website, both from falling short of job adverts, tired of being held to ransom by LinkedIn and as part of my own professional development. You will also learn the bitesize chunks I went about completing this task in while following Andrei's course, with the sprinklings of my own git VCS commits expanded on in a more coherent manner to document what things you may want from your own portfolio website!
